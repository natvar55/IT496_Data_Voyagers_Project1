# ðŸš€ Data Voyagers


## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

This project combines techniques in exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, data cleaning, and predictive modeling.

## 2. âœ¨ Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive into your data using helpful visuals to understand it better and discover interesting insights.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Make your data ready for analysis by handling missing values, sorting out different types of data, and making sure it's in a format that's easy to work with.

- **Data Cleaning:** Transform messy data into useful information by removing errors and inconsistencies.

- **Regression Models:** Use different techniques to make predictions with your data, including methods like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost Regression (XBGRegressor), and Random Forest Regression.

## 3. ðŸ“š Dataset Information

- **Dataset Description:** This dataset contains information about the usage of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations. It includes data on the location of charging stations, the time and duration of charging sessions, and various environmental factors.

## 4. ðŸŽ¯ Predictive Goals

  - **GHG Savings (Greenhouse Gas):** This prediction provides an estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions saved as a result of using EVs and charging from these stations. It's a crucial metric for understanding the environmental impact of electric vehicles.

  - **Charging Fee:** We aim to predict the charging fees associated with each charging session. This prediction can help users estimate their charging costs and promote cost-effective charging strategies.
 
  - **Charging Time:** We aim to estimate how long it will take for an electric vehicle (EV) to charge at a charging station. This prediction helps EV owners plan their charging schedules more effectively.
